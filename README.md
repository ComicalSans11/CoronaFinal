This game was developed as a final project for C220 as part of a 48-hour game jam. 

When we considered the theme of Corona, we thought about it this way: 

These are the struggles and surprises we encountered as we developed it:

These are the technologies and resources we used: Godot 3.2, V.S Code, GitHub, Piskel

This is the objective of the game: 'Flap' through the hands to get into the mouth of your owner, collect limes to make your drink extra tasty

This is how the game is played: Select the quit option in the start menu to quit and start in the start menu to start the game. Once the game is started use the space bar to jump your drink dodging the hands to get to the mouth. Whether you die or win you will get the options to play again or quit

Future plans: Adding more levels, and adding the ability to save your score.
